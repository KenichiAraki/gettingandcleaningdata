## About this dataset 
The script processes the source dataset, calculates and summarizes means of 
source data per subject and activity, and then writes a final dataset in a 
datafile.  

Each row of dataset consists of:
- an identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment,
- an activity label,
- means of 79 feature vectors, whose name includes mean() or std() in the 
source dataset; i.e. the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
